# HDBSCAN

HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is an advanced clustering algorithm that combines hierarchical clustering and density-based clustering. This method is designed to find clusters of varying shapes and sizes in data that may contain noise and outliers. Unlike traditional clustering algorithms, HDBSCAN does not require the user to specify the number of clusters, making it more flexible and adaptive.

## 1. Mutual Reachability Distance (MRD)

The mutual reachability distance is a key concept in HDBSCAN. It modifies the traditional distance metric to account for density, ensuring that dense regions of data are more likely to be clustered together. The mutual reachability distance between two points \(a\) and \(b\) is defined as:

$$
\text{MRD}(a, b) = \max\left(\text{core\_distance}(a), \text{core\_distance}(b), \text{distance}(a, b)\right)
$$

Here, the core distance of a point is the distance to its \(k\)-th nearest neighbor. This metric helps to build a more reliable distance matrix for clustering.

## 2. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

Once the mutual reachability distances are computed, the next step is to construct a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). An MST is a subgraph that connects all the points (nodes) together with the minimum possible total edge weight (distance) without any cycles.

In the context of HDBSCAN, the MST is built using the mutual reachability distances as edge weights. This tree structure helps in identifying the underlying hierarchical relationships within the data.

## 3. Condensed Cluster Tree

The condensed cluster tree is derived from the MST and represents the hierarchical clustering of the data. The process involves:

1. **Pruning the MST**: Remove edges with high mutual reachability distances, effectively breaking the tree into smaller components.
2. **Condensation**: Collapse smaller components that do not meet the minimum cluster size criterion into noise.

This condensed tree captures the hierarchical structure of clusters at different density levels, allowing the algorithm to adapt to clusters of varying shapes and sizes.

## 4. Extract the Clusters

The final step in HDBSCAN is to extract the clusters from the condensed cluster tree. This involves selecting a stability criterion to determine which clusters to retain. Stable clusters are those that persist over a wide range of scales (density levels) in the condensed tree.

### Real-World Example

Imagine you're analyzing customer data for a retail store, and you want to identify different customer segments based on their purchase behavior. Your data might contain outliers (e.g., rare big spenders) and clusters of various densities (e.g., frequent buyers vs. occasional shoppers). 

Using HDBSCAN, you can:

1. **Calculate Mutual Reachability Distances**: Adjust distances to account for customer behavior density.
2. **Build an MST**: Connect customers with similar behaviors.
3. **Create a Condensed Cluster Tree**: Identify hierarchical clusters, considering varying purchase frequencies and behaviors.
4. **Extract Stable Clusters**: Identify stable customer segments and label outliers as noise.

### Summary

HDBSCAN is a powerful clustering tool for complex datasets, offering the ability to find clusters without predefined numbers, handling noise and outliers effectively. It is particularly useful in scenarios where the data has a natural hierarchical structure and varying densities.
