# Roc

The ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. It is a fundamental tool in statistics, machine learning, and signal processing for evaluating the performance of classification models.

### ROC Curve
The ROC curve is a plot of the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: Also known as sensitivity or recall, it is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. It is calculated as:
   $$
   \text{TPR} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
   $$
   where $ TP $ is the number of true positives and $ FN $ is the number of false negatives.

2. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: It is the ratio of incorrectly predicted positive observations to all actual negatives. It is calculated as:
   $$
   \text{FPR} = \frac{FP}{FP + TN}
   $$
   where $ FP $ is the number of false positives and $ TN $ is the number of true negatives.

### AUC (Area Under the Curve)
The AUC, or Area Under the ROC Curve, is a single scalar value that summarizes the performance of a classifier. It represents the degree or measure of separability, indicating how much the model is capable of distinguishing between positive and negative classes. The AUC value ranges from 0 to 1:
- **AUC = 1**: Perfect classifier.
- **AUC = 0.5**: No discriminative power, equivalent to random guessing.
- **AUC < 0.5**: Indicates a model with worse-than-random performance, typically suggesting an issue with the model or data.

### Key Concepts and Calculations
1. **Threshold Variation**: The ROC curve is generated by varying the threshold used to map the predicted probabilities to class labels. Each point on the ROC curve corresponds to a specific threshold, showing the trade-off between TPR and FPR.

2. **Interpretation**:
   - A model with a ROC curve closer to the top-left corner indicates a better performance.
   - The diagonal line represents a random classifier (AUC = 0.5).
   - The area under the curve (AUC) provides a single measure to compare different models.

### Applications
- **Model Evaluation**: ROC curves and AUC are commonly used to evaluate the performance of classification models, particularly in imbalanced datasets.
- **Threshold Selection**: Helps in selecting the optimal threshold that balances sensitivity and specificity based on the desired trade-off.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Useful for comparing the performance of multiple models on the same dataset.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

**Advantages**:
- **Comprehensive Performance Metric**: Provides a complete picture of the classifierâ€™s performance across all thresholds.
- **Threshold Independence**: AUC is not dependent on a specific decision threshold, making it a robust measure.
- **Class Balance Independence**: ROC curves and AUC are less affected by class imbalance compared to accuracy.

**Disadvantages**:
- **Misleading for Highly Imbalanced Datasets**: In cases of extreme imbalance, ROC curves can sometimes give an overly optimistic view of the model performance.
- **Single Metric Limitation**: While AUC is a useful summary metric, it does not provide insights into specific threshold choices.
- **Complexity in Multi-Class Problems**: ROC analysis is straightforward for binary classification but becomes more complex for multi-class problems.

Understanding ROC, ROC curves, and AUC can significantly aid in building and evaluating robust classification models, ensuring that the chosen model performs well across different thresholds and is capable of distinguishing between classes effectively.

## notes

    !!! we will use 1 number - the AUC - as the score for the model !!!

* auc is a relative measure 
* it is not a good measure for imbalanced data
