# RANSAC

## RANdom SAmple Consensus

RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) is an iterative method for estimating parameters of a mathematical model from a set of observed data that contains outliers. It is particularly useful for regression problems where the dataset is contaminated with a significant proportion of outliers.

RANSAC achieves this by iteratively selecting a random subset of the data points, fitting a model to this subset, and then determining how many data points from the entire dataset fit the model within a certain tolerance. This process is repeated for a specified number of iterations, and the model with the highest number of inliers is selected as the final model.

### Algorithm Steps

1. **Randomly select a subset of the original data**. These points are called the consensus set.
2. **Fit a model** to the consensus set.
3. **Determine the inliers** for this model, i.e., data points from the entire dataset that fit the model within a certain tolerance.
4. **Count the number of inliers**. If the number of inliers is higher than a predefined threshold, re-estimate the model using all the inliers.
5. **Repeat** the process for a predefined number of iterations.
6. **Select the best model**, which has the highest number of inliers.

### Real-World Example

RANSAC is widely used in computer vision for tasks such as image stitching, where the goal is to find a homography matrix that aligns two images despite the presence of mismatched feature points.

### Example

Let's demonstrate how to use RANSAC for linear regression using Python and scikit-learn.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import RANSACRegressor, LinearRegression
from sklearn.datasets import make_regression

# Generate synthetic data with outliers
np.random.seed(42)
X, y = make_regression(n_samples=100, n_features=1, noise=10)
X[:10] += 10  # Add outliers in the data
y[:10] += 50  # Add outliers in the data

# Fit RANSAC model
ransac = RANSACRegressor(LinearRegression(), max_trials=100, min_samples=50, residual_threshold=15, random_state=42)
ransac.fit(X, y)
inlier_mask = ransac.inlier_mask_
outlier_mask = np.logical_not(inlier_mask)

# Predict using RANSAC model
line_X = np.arange(X.min(), X.max())[:, np.newaxis]
line_y_ransac = ransac.predict(line_X)

# Plot results
plt.scatter(X[inlier_mask], y[inlier_mask], color='yellowgreen', marker='.', label='Inliers')
plt.scatter(X[outlier_mask], y[outlier_mask], color='red', marker='.', label='Outliers')
plt.plot(line_X, line_y_ransac, color='cornflowerblue', label='RANSAC regressor')
plt.legend(loc='upper left')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('y')
plt.title('RANSAC Regression')
plt.show()
```

### Practical Use

- **Robust Regression**: RANSAC is particularly useful when the dataset contains a significant proportion of outliers that can skew the results of traditional regression models.
- **Computer Vision**: It is widely used in tasks like image stitching, object recognition, and 3D reconstruction to handle noisy and outlier-prone data.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: In GPS trajectory fitting and other spatial data analyses, where measurements can be erratic and contain outliers.

### Conclusion

RANSAC is a powerful and robust method for fitting models to data with outliers. By iteratively selecting random subsets and fitting models, RANSAC effectively identifies the inliers and produces a reliable model that is not overly influenced by outliers. It is an essential tool in various fields, particularly where data quality is a concern.
