<h2>Linear Regression with LASSO (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({L}_{1}\)</span>) / Ridge (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\({L}_{2}\)</span>) Regularization<a class="headerlink" href="#linear-regression-with-lasso-l-1-ridge-l-2-regularization" title="Permalink to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Regularization is a simple and effective way to balance the adaptation of the model to the data.<br />
It allows us to use complex model yet to tune it to prevent overfit.</p>
<p>The models of optimization:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>LASSO: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\arg \min_{\boldsymbol{w}} \frac{1}{2} {\left\| X \boldsymbol{w} - \boldsymbol{y} \right\|}_{2}^{2} + \lambda {\left\| \boldsymbol{w} \right\|}_{1}\)</span>.<br />
Promotes sparsity, modeled by a Laplace prior of the coefficients of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{w}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Ridge: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\arg \min_{\boldsymbol{w}} \frac{1}{2} {\left\| X \boldsymbol{w} - \boldsymbol{y} \right\|}_{2}^{2} + \lambda {\left\| \boldsymbol{w} \right\|}_{2}^{2}\)</span>.<br />
Promotes damped coefficients, modeled by a Gaussian prior of the coefficients of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{w}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><font color='brown'>(<strong>#</strong>)</font> The LASSO model is implemented by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Lasso</span></code> class in SciKit Learn.</p></li>
<li><p><font color='brown'>(<strong>#</strong>)</font> The Ridge model is implemented by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ridge</span></code> class in SciKit Learn.</p></li>
<li><p><font color='brown'>(<strong>#</strong>)</font> Both <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Lasso</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Ridge</span></code> (As well as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LinearRegression</span></code>) have the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">positive</span></code> parameter to enforce non negative values for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\boldsymbol{w}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p><font color='brown'>(<strong>#</strong>)</font> The SciKit Learn classes use <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\alpha\)</span> instead of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\lambda\)</span> in their optimization function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In this notebook we’ll show the effect of the regularization on the fitness level of the model.</p>
