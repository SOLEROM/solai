# feature processing

## Pre Process
* steps as handling missing data
* outlier rejection 

## Feature Engineering
* Feature Transform / Feature Extraction  
    * Applying operators to generate additional features out of the given features, the operations can be: 
        * Polynomial, 
        * Statistical, 
        * Normalization, 
        * Change of Coordinates
 
* Dimensionality Reduction  - reduce the number of features to maximize the inner structure of the data. 

* Feature Selection  - only a sub set of the features are used, selected by statistical tests or closed loop evaluation.
