# MiniRocket

MiniRocket is a state-of-the-art time series classification algorithm that offers a fast and efficient method for classifying time series data. It's a scaled-down version of the original Rocket (RandOm Convolutional KErnel Transform) algorithm, designed to enhance speed while maintaining high accuracy.

## Overview

MiniRocket stands out by using a fixed set of random convolutional kernels, prioritizing simplicity and computational efficiency. Here’s a breakdown of its key components:

- **Random Convolutional Kernels**: MiniRocket employs a large number of these to transform the input time series into a set of features.
- **Feature Extraction**: These features are then utilized to train a linear classifier, such as logistic regression or a support vector machine (SVM).
- **Fixed Set of Kernels**: The use of a fixed set allows for extremely rapid feature computation and makes the method highly scalable to large datasets.

## How MiniRocket Works

### Step 1: Random Convolutional Kernels

MiniRocket starts by applying a large number of random convolutional kernels to the input time series data. These kernels are fixed and predetermined, ensuring that the transformation process is quick and consistent.

### Step 2: Feature Extraction

The convolutional operations transform the time series into a new feature space. This transformation captures various patterns and characteristics of the time series data, making it suitable for classification tasks.

### Step 3: Linear Classification

The extracted features are then used to train a linear classifier. The choice of classifier can vary, but commonly used ones include:

- **Logistic Regression**: Suitable for binary classification tasks.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Can be used for both binary and multi-class classification.

## Advantages of MiniRocket

1. **Speed**: The fixed set of convolutional kernels allows for extremely fast computation of features.
2. **Simplicity**: The approach is straightforward, involving basic convolution operations and linear classification.
3. **Scalability**: MiniRocket's efficiency makes it highly scalable, capable of handling large datasets effectively.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Stock Price Prediction

In financial markets, predicting stock prices based on historical data is crucial. MiniRocket can transform time series data of stock prices into features that help predict future price movements. By training a logistic regression model on these features, analysts can classify future price trends (e.g., whether the price will go up or down).

### Example 2: Healthcare Monitoring

Time series data in healthcare, such as patient vital signs, can be classified to detect anomalies or predict medical conditions. MiniRocket can quickly process large volumes of such data, extracting features that are used to train an SVM classifier, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.

### Example 3: Industrial Equipment Monitoring

In industrial settings, monitoring equipment health through time series data (like vibration or temperature readings) is vital for predictive maintenance. MiniRocket can efficiently classify these time series to identify potential equipment failures before they occur, reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

### MiniRocket in Practice

Here’s a high-level pseudo-code to illustrate how MiniRocket works in practice:

```python
# Pseudo-code for MiniRocket implementation

# Step 1: Apply random convolutional kernels to time series data
features = apply_random_convolutional_kernels(time_series_data)

# Step 2: Train a linear classifier on the extracted features
classifier = train_linear_classifier(features, labels)

# Step 3: Use the trained classifier for prediction
predictions = classifier.predict(new_time_series_data)
```

MiniRocket's combination of speed, simplicity, and scalability makes it a powerful tool for time series classification, applicable across various real-world scenarios.
