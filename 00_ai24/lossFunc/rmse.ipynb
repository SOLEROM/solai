    "### Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is a widely used metric to measure the accuracy of a predictive model. It represents the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted values and actual values. Here's a breakdown of what this means:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Understanding RMSE\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Calculation**: For each prediction made by the model, calculate the difference between the predicted value and the actual value. This difference is known as the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Square the Errors**: Each error is squared to ensure all values are positive, emphasizing larger errors more than smaller ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Average the Squared Errors**: Compute the mean (average) of these squared errors. This gives an overall measure of the model's error, known as Mean Squared Error (MSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Square Root**: Finally, take the square root of the MSE to return to the original units of the predicted values. This is the RMSE.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The RMSE is mathematically represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\[ \\text{RMSE} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \\hat{y}_i)^2} \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( n \\) is the number of observations.\n",
    "- \\( y_i \\) is the actual value.\n",
    "- \\( \\hat{y}_i \\) is the predicted value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unit Consistency**: RMSE has the same units as the predicted values, making it easier to interpret and compare.\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to Outliers**: Due to squaring the errors, RMSE is particularly sensitive to outliers. Large errors have a disproportionately large impact on the RMSE.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation**: A lower RMSE indicates a better fit of the model to the data, meaning the predictions are closer to the actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE is a crucial metric for assessing the performance of regression models. It provides a clear measure of how well the model's predictions match the actual data, with lower values indicating better accuracy."
