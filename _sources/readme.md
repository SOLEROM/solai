### AI24

* This repository contains summaries and materials based on a course I took at the Technion.

* Course Materials: The lab exercises are adapted from the [instructor's public GitHub repository](https://github.com/FixelAlgorithmsTeam/FixelCourses/tree/master/AIProgram)

* The topics covered in class are summarized and rewritten with the assistance of ChatGPT to ensure they are suitable for public sharing while respecting the original work and intellectual property of the course creators.
