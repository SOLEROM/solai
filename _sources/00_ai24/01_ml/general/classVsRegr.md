# Classification vs Regression

Classification and regression are two core types of tasks in supervised learning, which is a branch of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data. The main difference between them lies in the output type they are predicting.

## Classification

Classification tasks involve categorizing input data into predefined classes or labels. The output variable in classification is discrete, meaning it takes on a limited number of categorical values. Classification can be binary (e.g., spam or not spam) or multiclass (e.g., predicting the type of fruit based on its characteristics).

Examples:

    Email spam detection (spam or not spam).
    Image recognition (categorizing images into predefined categories).
    Disease diagnosis (determining the type of disease from symptoms).

## Regression

Regression tasks predict a continuous quantity. The output variable in regression is a real value, which means it can take on any number within a range. Regression is used when the goal is to predict a quantity rather than a category.

Examples

    Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of bedrooms.
    Estimating a person's age based on their physical characteristics.
    Forecasting stock prices.
