# Non parametric regression

* parametric model is good to extrapolate the next data
* non parametric model is poor in that case but work with no knowledge of the data model;


## Intro

Non-parametric regression is useful when you have little prior knowledge about the relationship between the predictors and the response variable or when the relationship is known to be complex and not well described by a simple parametric model.
