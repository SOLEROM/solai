# feature importances

## (1) .feature_importances_

This attribute of the Random Forest model (RandomForestClassifier or RandomForestRegressor) gives a measure of the importance of each feature. The importance is calculated based on how much each feature decreases the impurity of a split in the trees forming the forest. The impurity decrease from each feature is averaged across all the trees within the model to determine its importance

Benefits:
* easy to use
* fast to compute

Drawbacks:
* Bias: Tends to favor numerical features and those with more categories since they can create more unique splits.
* overfitting Bias: Especially in cases with noisy features, they might appear more important because they affect overfitted splits.


## (2) permutation_importance

* https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.inspection.permutation_importance.html

This method assesses feature importance by evaluating the decrease in a model’s performance (score) when the values of one feature are randomly shuffled. This process breaks the relationship between the feature and the target, thus the drop in the model performance indicates the importance of the feature. 

steps:

    * Fit Model: Train your model on the original data.
    * Permute Feature: Randomly shuffle values of a feature in the validation set and calculate the decrease in the model’s performance.
    * Repeat: The permutation is repeated multiple times to estimate the importance of the feature.

benefits:
    * Model Agnostic: It can be used with any model, giving it versatility.
    * Less Bias: Does not favor features based on their cardinality or datatype.

drawbacks:
    * Computationally Expensive: Requires re-evaluating the model multiple times, once for each feature and permutation.
    * Sensitivity to Data Leakage: If the data has leakage, the shuffled feature might still be predicted by other correlated features, underestimating the importance.


GPT

In the context of Random Forests in scikit-learn and other similar machine learning libraries, there are different methods to assess the importance of features in predicting the target variable. Understanding the distinction between feature_importances_ and the permutation_importance method can help you choose the appropriate approach depending on your analysis needs.
1. feature_importances_

This attribute of the Random Forest model (RandomForestClassifier or RandomForestRegressor) gives a measure of the importance of each feature. The importance is calculated based on how much each feature decreases the impurity of a split in the trees forming the forest. The impurity decrease from each feature is averaged across all the trees within the model to determine its importance. The benefits of using feature_importances_ include:

    Speed: It is computed during the training process of the trees, making it fast and efficient.
    Ease of Use: Directly accessible from the trained model with no need for additional computation.

However, it has limitations:

    Bias: Tends to favor numerical features and those with more categories since they can create more unique splits.
    Overfitting Bias: Especially in cases with noisy features, they might appear more important because they affect overfitted splits.

2. permutation_importance

This method assesses feature importance by evaluating the decrease in a model’s performance (score) when the values of one feature are randomly shuffled. This process breaks the relationship between the feature and the target, thus the drop in the model performance indicates the importance of the feature. The steps involved are:

    Fit Model: Train your model on the original data.
    Permute Feature: Randomly shuffle values of a feature in the validation set and calculate the decrease in the model’s performance.
    Repeat: The permutation is repeated multiple times to estimate the importance of the feature.

The benefits of using permutation_importance include:

    Model Agnostic: It can be used with any model, giving it versatility.
    Less Bias: Does not favor features based on their cardinality or datatype.

However, it has its own drawbacks:

    Computationally Expensive: Requires re-evaluating the model multiple times, once for each feature and permutation.
    Sensitivity to Data Leakage: If the data has leakage, the shuffled feature might still be predicted by other correlated features, underestimating the importance.

# Which to Use When?

Use feature_importances_ when:
* You need a quick and simple measure directly from the model.
* You are using tree-based models and the dataset doesn’t have high cardinality features or you are not worried about biases towards such features.

Use permutation_importance when:
* You want a more reliable method that accounts for potential interactions between features.
* You are comparing feature importance across different models or you need a less biased measure.
* You are prepared to handle the computational cost for a more thorough analysis.

In practice, checking both can provide a more comprehensive view of feature importance, especially if they significantly diverge, which might indicate specific biases or interactions in your data that need closer examination.
