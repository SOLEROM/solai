# human intuition

* the XOR challenge example - show why human intuition is important in solving problems:

changing the len of the input vectors

human intuition to solve the problem:

* divide the longer vector into smaller vectors as the len of the training set
* compute the XOR of the smaller vectors
* combine the results to get the final result

## depending on the data example

if fake model will say each person it is shown have no diesase, the model will have high accuracy because the majority of the people are healthy. But the model is not useful.
