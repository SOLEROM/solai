# Pre-Defined Models

Every Deep Learning framework offers **Pre-Defined models**. Loading them can be done in two flavors:

1. **Model Definition**
   * This involves loading only the model definition of the architecture.
   * It is used for a vanilla training of the model.

2. **Model Definition with Pre-Trained Weights**
   * This involves loading the model with pre-trained weights on some dataset.
   * It is used in production or for **Transfer Learning**.

## Detailed Explanation

### 1. Model Definition

**Overview:**
When you load only the model definition, you are essentially importing the architecture of the neural network. This means the model will have randomly initialized weights, and you will need to train it from scratch on your specific dataset. This approach is useful when you want to experiment with new data, different hyperparameters, or when you simply want to understand the behavior of the model from the ground up.

**Real-World Example:**
Suppose you want to train a ResNet model on a new medical imaging dataset to identify anomalies. By loading only the model definition, you can adjust the architecture to better suit your specific problem, such as changing the number of layers or modifying the activation functions.

### 2. Model Definition with Pre-Trained Weights

**Overview:**
Loading a model with pre-trained weights means you start with a model that has already been trained on a large dataset, like ImageNet. These weights are often quite effective at capturing general features that are transferable to other tasks. This approach is particularly useful for **Transfer Learning**, where you fine-tune a pre-trained model on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This can significantly speed up training and improve performance, especially when you have limited data.

**Real-World Example:**
Imagine you are working on a project to classify different species of birds using a relatively small dataset. Instead of training a model from scratch, you can use a pre-trained model like VGG16, which has been trained on ImageNet. You can then fine-tune this model on your bird dataset, leveraging the features learned from the large dataset to improve performance on your specific task.

## Practical Usage in PyTorch

Here's a brief guide on how to load both types of models using PyTorch.

### Loading Only the Model Definition

```python
import torchvision.models as models

# Load the ResNet-50 model definition
model = models.resnet50()

# Now you need to train the model from scratch
```

### Loading the Model with Pre-Trained Weights

```python
import torchvision.models as models

# Load the ResNet-50 model with pre-trained weights
model = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)

# Fine-tune the model on your specific dataset
# You can freeze some layers and only train the final layers if needed
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

# Replace the final layer for your specific classification task
num_features = model.fc.in_features
model.fc = nn.Linear(num_features, num_classes)

# Now you can train the model on your specific dataset
```

By using pre-trained models, you can achieve better performance more quickly, especially when working with limited data. Whether you start from scratch or fine-tune a pre-trained model, understanding these options allows you to make informed decisions based on your project's requirements.
